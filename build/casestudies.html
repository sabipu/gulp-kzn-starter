                            <p>The utility wanted to be able to efficiently manage electricity costs by visualising real-time energy costs, energy constraints, weather conditions (which is a driver of spot energy prices) and power consumption across their plant equipment. This visualisation was to be through a dashboard.</p>
                            <p>Due to the criticality of this application, the utility needed a highly reliable solution.</p>

                            <p>KZN proposed a highly reliable, sverless AWS dashboard solution which had automatic failover between managed databases in multiple availability zones. This also included a CI/CD pipeline to allow easy migration of software from development to test to production enviroments.</p>
                            <p>CloudFormation was used to set up entire DevOps environment and the dashboard infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>CloudFormation was used to set up the following in the DevOps account:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- CodeCommit repositories to store workload account infrastructure in application code</li>
                                <li>- CodePipelines to build, test and deploy workload infrastructure and application</li>
                                <li>- Elastic Container Repository to contain dashboard application</li>
                                <li>- CI/CD pipelines to deploy all infrastructure (see below)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>CloudFormation had also been used to set up the following infrastructure:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Relational Database Service (RDS) instance in multi-AZ configuration and encrypted at rest with KMS</li>
                                <li>- Fargate service to provide high availability of Dashboard application</li>
                                <li>- Fargate task to run Dashboard application in VPC</li>
                                <li>- Application Load Balancer to provide a single point of contact for end-users and terminate HTTPS in-flight encryption</li>
                                <li>- Kinesis Data Streams and Firehoses for data sources</li>                                
                            </ul>
                            <p>As a benefit of using CloudFormation, the utility can easily standup new enviroments and store the infrastructure together with the application code.</p>

                            <p>The new Energy Management Dashboard is now hosted on a highly reliable, scalable managed cloud platform. this takes advantage of serverless technologies to remove server management overheads.</p>
                            <p>CloudFormation means that an identical, version-controlled DevOps account and infrastructure can be stood up at short notice for testing. This also means that manual configuration work is minimised, and the exact infrastructure specification can be stored with the application code. CloudFormation leverages serverless technologies by scripting the entire deployment process.</p>
                            <p>As a benifit of using CloudFormation, the utility can easily standup new environments for development and testing.</p>

                            <p>Engineers for a major Western Australian chemical manufacturer needed a cloud-hosted data lake for analytics platform to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety in their manufacturing plants.</p>
                            <p>This project was a focused solution using a single data source (once historical data was migrated from legacy systems).

                            queries, or by SageMaker for machine learning.</p>
                            <p>CloudFormation was used to build all the environments for the application and the associated DevOps, allowing “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC). This allows a very systematic deployment process and for the

                          <p>The ongoing capability of ILC’s previous hosting environment to support the NED application was in jeopardy due to viability concerns with the application developer and hosting provider. The existing operational and software development processes were no longer fit for purpose, with incidents of uncontrolled releases to production causing disruption and confusion among the user base. Inadequate development and testing environments meant that critical system and library upgrades could not be safely integrated into the production systems, causing the application’s libraries and dependencies to slip further and further out of date, and making the IT function slow to respond to business and end-user requirements.</p>

                            <p>KZN’s team of AWS Certified Professionals defined a two step strategy that included a tactical lift-and-shift followed by a technical transformation, implementing a DevOps culture, tooling and processes.</p>
                            <span class="title">Lift and Shift</span>
                            <p>KZN first worked with ILCWA on a lift-and-shift migration into AWS, moving quickly to re-host all ILCWA servers into the AWS EC2 service using the Import/Export tool to provide an immediate tactial resolution and ensure continued availability and viability of the critical NED application. Once the environment was stabilised, a modernisation program was undertaken to introduce advanced cloud technologies.</p>
                            <span class="title">Technical Transformation</span>
                            <p>KZN re-architected, built, deployed and tested the NED application stack onto AWS. The Ruby on Rails application code and infrastructure-as-code templates are managed together in the GitHub hosted version control system, which is the entry point into a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline leveraging a number of AWS services including CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CloudFormation. Once unit testing is successful, an immutable AMI image of the OS, application code and configuration is created using the Hashicorp Packer tool. The pipeline then deploys the entire application stack into an ephemeral staging environment where integration testing and optional user acceptance testing (UAT) is performed before being deployed into production. Once approved, the staging environment is automatically terminated to reduce costs. Autoscaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and RDS Multi-AZ services provide high availability at every layer of the application stack, with static and media content saved into and served directly out of S3, further reducing load on the web servers and simplifying the persistence of data. Application and system logs are streamed from the EC2 instances into the CloudWatch Logs service where rich logstream analysis alerts the operators to divergence from expected application behaviour.</p>
                            <p>Security and access to the platform are protected using AWS accounts separated by environment (staging and production), least-privilege IAM users and groups, cross-account roles and multi-factor authentication devices. The CloudTrail service provides a tamper-resistant, centralised audit trail of all actions taken across all AWS accounts.</p>
                            <p>Infrastructure and application performance and availability metrics are closely monitored using CloudWatch with alarms fed via SNS to the operations team’s ChatOps platform Slack. Additionally, the team are notified of infrastructure events such as autoscaling actions and CI/CD pipeline stage outcomes, helping them to understand in real-time the state of the build process and production environment.</p>

                            <p>Moving to a CI/CD model of application delivery has given ILCWA greater confidence in the development and release of new features, which are now demonstrated in a staging environment and can be released to production within minutes and at any time of day. Having the entire application stack defined using infrastructure-as-code allows individual developers to engineer and test their code in their own isolated production analogue environments, and was critical to enabling the efficient uplift of application libraries and dependencies to secure and functional versions.</p>
                            <p>Advanced AWS managed services such as Autoscaling, Elastic Load Balancing and RDS drastically increased availability while reducing operational costs, and indeed have delivered near-100% uptime over the life of the solution to date. The offloading of static content into S3 has simplified deployment and backup procedures; when combined with autoscaling, the application can respond dynamically to changes in request volume over time.</p>
                            <p>With staging and development environments provisioned on-demand, and automatically terminated when no longer in use it allows ILC to manage costs by only playing resources currently in use.</p>
                            <p>Security is much improved, with immutable infrastructure and no direct access to the production environment. Only reviewed and approved code and infrastructure changes are introduced to the environment, and all access is via multi-factor authenticated and well-defined role-based access adhering to the principle of least privilege.</p>

                          <p>Navitas were facing a large scale roll-out within a very short time frame but with the various teams that develop and operate the system already highly constrained, there was a risk that without becoming more agile, the development process may not have been able to keep up with increasing business demands resulting in missed deadlines and lost market opportunities. For example, the process for taking a new piece of software code from the developer into production involved careful planning and a number of manual steps, creating delays, uncertainty and consuming valuable developer time. The existing strategy of defining entire complex software stacks as a single monolithic template had the potential to hinder agility by preventing infrastructure components such as the web frontend and API backends from being deployed and managed as separate entities from the very large but mostly static database, significantly impacting the speed of development.</p>

                            <span class="title">KZN’s solution</span>
                            <p>Initially, KZN engaged with Navitas in an advisory role to gain an understanding of the existing business, cultural, organisational and technical landscape. Based on this process, a findings report detailing the current state, where Navitas’s posture sat in relation to best practices, and a prioritised list of recommendations for remediation of any shortcomings was produced. KZN then embarked on a DevOps cultural uplift, enablement and technical remediation program to assist with aligning to AWS best practice process and tooling. KZN augmented Navitas’s DevOps team, providing guidance, delivery of the remediation items, as well as advisory services on a number of future initiatives.</p>
                            <p>While Navitas had already adopted a continuous integration (CI) process using the on-premises Jenkins CI tool, by leveraging key enabling AWS services including CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, KZN and Navitas replaced the manual deployment process with a fully automated, end-to-end continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process that saw code committed to the main branch of the on-premises BitBucket code repository deployed into production within minutes instead of hours and with no further planning, manual install steps or other intervention required from the devops team.</p>
                            <p>In adopting the CI/CD model of delivery, the CodeBuild service plays a key role in generating reproducible, deployable application artefacts including all library dependencies, executing quality and test processes, and installing and configuring infrastructure instrumentation and monitoring components. Within a CodeBuild project, the Hashicorp Packer tool generates reproducible AMIs and docker images for application and test environments including the CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs and CodeDeploy agents. These images are then launched into deployment groups using the AutoScaling capability as the targets for software deployment using the CodeDeploy service.</p>
                            <p>To accelerate the development process and facilitate on-demand dev/test environment provisioning, KZN refactored the existing CloudFormation template into discrete infrastructure functional components as a series of loosely coupled systems.</p>

                            <p>Moving to a full CI/CD model of delivery has given Navitas greater confidence that software changes will be released to production quickly and reliably. The increased agility of the DevOps pipeline has enhanced IT’s ability to keep up with business demands and focus on delivering value.</p>
                            <p>Making the infrastructure more modular allows development and test environments to be created and destroyed orders of magnitude faster that was previously possible, while also reducing costs. Developers now spend more time delivering business value and less time roadblocked waiting for infrastructure provisioning and environment refresh tasks to complete.</p>
